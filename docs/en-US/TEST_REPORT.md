- **Shortest test**: 0ms (unit tests)
- **Total time**: Deno ~44–45s / Bun ~38s

## 🎯 Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Comprehensive**: All core features and edge cases covered
2. **Stable**: All tests pass consistently
3. **Fast**: Most tests complete in milliseconds
4. **Integration**: End-to-end tests for real scenarios
5. **Security**: Encrypted communication and validation tests

### Suggestions

1. **Performance**: Add more performance benchmarks
2. **Stress**: Add high-concurrency tests
3. **Compatibility**: Add more runtime environment tests

## ✅ Conclusion

All 189 unit tests pass across three runtimes (Deno 206 incl. lifecycle hooks /
Bun 189 / Node 189, 100% pass rate). Core functionality, edge cases, and
integration scenarios are well covered. New API methods (once,
removeAllListeners, socketsJoin, socketsLeave, fetchSockets, disconnectSockets,
Server emit/to/in/except) are tested. Optimization features (error i18n tr,
adapter generics, memory/timer review, API optimization) are covered. Code
quality is high, functionality is stable, and the library is suitable for
production use across Deno, Bun, and Node.js 22+.
